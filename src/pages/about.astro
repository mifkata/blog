            <p>
              By 19 I'd moved to Sofia alone, broke, and stubborn enough to
              think that was a good idea. I spent my teenage years ignoring
              school, obsessed with computers, video games, and the idea of
              becoming a hacker. When I got my first PC in '98, I thought I'd be
              a designer, but life shoved me into programming — PHP, websites,
              anything that paid rent. That's how it started.

            People tend to misread me. I come off as strange to the average
            person, so I gravitate toward creatives and oddballs who find me
            normal. My humor is dark, sarcastic, and occasionally snobbish. I
            talk a lot. I can sound arrogant.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-dark">
            Some think I'm mean when they first meet me, but if they stay long
            enough, they discover I'm different in a way they actually enjoy. I
            make friends easily, but I keep my circle small on purpose.
