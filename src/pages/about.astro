      I get obsessive about learning; even after 25+ years of programming, I
      still compare myself to "real" engineers and feel like I'm far behind.
      Coffee in the morning is non-negotiable. Everything else can fall apart.

    <p class="text-gray-dark mb-4">
      People tend to misread me. I come off as strange to the average person, so
      I gravitate toward creatives and oddballs who find me normal. My humor is
      dark, sarcastic, and occasionally snobbish. I talk a lot. I can sound
      arrogant.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-dark">
      Some think I'm mean when they first meet me, but if they stay long enough,
      they discover I'm different in a way they actually enjoy. I make friends
      easily, but I keep my circle small on purpose.

      I'm learning languages, going to the gym, and pushing myself through
      university because I want to teach someday. Maybe that's my way of giving
      back — or maybe I just like making things harder than they need to be.
