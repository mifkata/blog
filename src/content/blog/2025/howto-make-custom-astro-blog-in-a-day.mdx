## The idea

I've been working on a few personal projects on the side and one of the things that I'm setting up for them is my marketing environment - the **public web**. Now, I don't know how you've struggled with making a high-performant public website, but I've been (un)fortunate enough to have done it at least a good hundred times, only in this lifetime.

The main requirements for such software is:

- **Extensibility** - easy to manage manually, as it is to plug any kind of data source to it and make it dynamic
- **Maintainability** - easy to update, upgrade and keep secure
- **Performance** - fast, light and optimized for SEO, accessibility, anything that gets you that high Lighthouse score

Surely you can pile on that list with cost efficiency, ease of use, and whatnot, but those three are the main ones that I care about at this stage.

## The process, as it used to be

So here a breakdown of how these things fruition to life usually:

1. **Conceptualize** - decide what you want to build and why (this is part of your R&D process)
2. **Research** - look for existing solutions, frameworks, and tools that can help you
3. **Design** - create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes of the website
4. **Develop** - write the code, set up the infrastructure, and integrate any necessary services
5. **Test** - ensure everything works as expected, fix bugs, and optimize performance
6. **Deploy** - launch the website and monitor its performance
7. **Maintain** - update content, fix issues, and improve features over time

Looks pretty cool and very much _enterprise_ - this is how big companies do it. Unfortunately, I'm a single dude (not single, single, just working alone), trying to make it and the main goal is **go to market ASAP**. This means I have to cut down on my decision making and strive for going live, over planning, researching, etc.

## The Status Quo

One of the biggest issues with running personal projects - you might end up not finishing them... ever! So, for now, all I want to do is get my blog out of the door. NOW‼️

So here's what I did in the order of execution:

1. **R&D the content** - went to ChatGPT and asked it to show me a list of famous software engineer's personal websites. Made a list of thins that I want to show on my website. <Highlight>Specal thanks to [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me) for inspiring me how to organise my own blog. I stole [giscus](https://giscus.app/bg) from there, to make blog post comments.</Highlight>
2. **R&D the stack** - I checked some open-source libraries for timelines, checked some stuff about animations and I had big plans to go heavy with some WebGL, canvas, custom timeline component, etc. The I said to myself - "my dude, this is not how you life quick".

... So I went to work

I picked [Astro](https://astro.build/) as my main framework, because:

- It has first-class support for static sites
- It has a great ecosystem of components and integrations
- It allows me to use my favorite frontend frameworks (like React, Svelte, etc.)
- It has great performance out of the box

3. **Getting to business** - I started with the [Astro Starter Kit: blog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/blog) and went on to deploying it to Cloudflare Pages. At first I had issues making `wrangler` work, <Highlight>so I decided instead of clicking in the Cloudflare UI to provision the app with [terraform](https://github.com/mifkata/blog/tree/main/terraform).</Highlight> Whoot! Few minutes later, after figuring out the correct token permissions, and I had deployed successfully and could see my placeholder template live. I added a domain record to point to the pages' build and voila! My blog was live!

## Time to vibe-code

ℹ️ Before I started modifying, I decided to mark the milestone and made [my first blog post](https://mifkata.com/blog/2025/init-blog/) and capture a few screenshots of the default template to commemorate the event.

- I used [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) to pick a nice color palette for my blog.
- I asked **ChatGPT** to interview me about the [About page](https://mifkata.com/about/) and help me figure out what to put in the footer, besides a boring copyright label.
- I ran my CV thorugh both **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** to get an extensive breakdown of what I can use for the [services page](https://mifkata.com/services/) as well as for [my resume](https://mifkata.com/resume/).
- I fed both variants (for services and resume) to **Claude** and instructed it to generate the pages.
- Used **nano banana** to generate some custom illustrations for the blog posts and the homepage, and of course a custom [404 page](https://mifkata.com/404/).
- Did some polishing back and forth until I was satisfied and thought that it's not embarassing for me to deploy.

## The result

Here's the final result - [mifkata.com](https://mifkata.com). What do you think? Was the effort worth it? Did I miss something important? Let me know in the comments below!
