## The premise

I’ve built more public-facing websites than I care to admit—at least a hundred in this lifetime alone. After a while, you notice the real requirements never change:

- **Extensibility** — dead simple to maintain, yet flexible enough to plug into anything
- **Maintainability** — no fragile setups, no yak-shaving
- **Performance** — fast, small, SEO-friendly, Lighthouse-obsessed

You can add cost efficiency, ease of use, scalability and so on, but these three are the real pillars. Hit them and the rest follows.

## The traditional process (the one I ignored)

This is how the corporate world rolls:

1. **Conceptualize** — figure out what and why
2. **Research** — evaluate frameworks and tools
3. **Design** — mockups, prototypes, infinite Figma loops
4. **Develop** — code + infra
5. **Test** — QA, performance passes, fixes
6. **Deploy** — ship it
7. **Maintain** — iterate forever

Very clean, very enterprise, very slow for a single person trying to get something out the door before the heat death of the universe.

My actual goal? **Ship fast. Get to market. No excuses.**

## The reality of personal projects

If you overthink a personal project, it dies. So I set one rule for myself:

> Ship the blog **today**, not “when it’s perfect.”

Here’s exactly what I did, in order:

### 1. R&D the content

I asked ChatGPT for examples of personal websites from well-known engineers, skimmed through them, and made my own list of what I wanted.

  Special thanks to [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me) — she inspired the way I
  structured my blog. I also shamelessly stole [giscus](https://giscus.app/bg)
  from her site for comments.

### 2. R&D the stack

Originally I wanted animations, WebGL, custom timelines, canvas toys… Then I looked in the mirror and said:

> “My dude, this is not how you ship fast.”

So I reached for the tool that gives you the most velocity:

### 🚀 Why Astro?

- First-class static site generation
- Rich ecosystem + integrations
- Lets you drop in React/Svelte/etc. only when needed
- Obscene performance by default

Exactly what I needed.

### 3. Bootstrapping + deployment

I started from the official starter:

➡️ **Astro Starter Kit: Blog**  
https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/blog

Then deployed to **Cloudflare Pages**.

Wrangler gave me some trouble, so I automated the whole setup with Terraform:

  I provisioned the entire project using
  [Terraform](https://github.com/mifkata/blog/tree/main/terraform) because
  clicking around in the Cloudflare UI is for people with free time.

A few minutes later: deploy done, DNS pointed, blog live.

## Time to vibe-code

Before touching anything, I wrote [my first post](https://mifkata.com/blog/2025/init-blog/) and grabbed screenshots of the default template — a little timestamp for future me.

Then the real fun began:

- Picked a palette via **Color Hunt**
- Let **ChatGPT** interview me for the About page + footer ideas
- Ran my CV through **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** to extract a proper services/resume breakdown
- Fed that into **Claude**, which generated both pages cleanly
- Used **nano banana** to create illustrations, including a custom [404 page](https://mifkata.com/404/)
- Polished until it no longer felt embarrassing

## The result

The final product: **[mifkata.com](https://mifkata.com)**

Was building a full custom Astro blog in a day worth it?  
Absolutely.
