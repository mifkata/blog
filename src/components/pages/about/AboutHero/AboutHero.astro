      <p class="text-xl text-gray mb-4">
        Born in Varna, Bulgaria in 1983. Started working when most people were
        still figuring out what to study.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-dark">
        By 19 I'd moved to Sofia alone, broke, and stubborn enough to think that
        was a good idea. I spent my teenage years ignoring school, obsessed with
        computers, video games, and the idea of becoming a hacker. When I got my
        first PC in '98, I thought I'd be a designer, but life shoved me into
        programming — PHP, websites, anything that paid rent. That's how it
        started.
